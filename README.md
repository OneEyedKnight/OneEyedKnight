<p> I am a mess and no lifer that can program in seven different programming languages. Outside of coding I play video games (primarily Minecraft), like to cook, and read online. 
I am currently a high school senior wanting to pursue Computer Science as a major to become a software engineer. I can never write lines of code that work on the first try and always commit code without double-checking it.

Languages I worked with: <br>
Python <br>
SQL <br>
JavaScript <br>
HTML <br>
CSS <br>
PHP <br>
